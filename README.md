# There the important three features of this project
* Firstly We can see any card details whatever we want in the details preview
* Secondly we can donate somecard or category to which will be disabled to select again. After selecting it will take you to the donation page directly where there will be a details button again to come back to the details page
* Thirdly, whatever we donate is directly saved into our local storage, which we are using for our further tasks like showing donation cards and statistics in a pie chart that how many donations I have made within the total card.
